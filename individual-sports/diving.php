          <p class="athlete-info"><h4>  In the late 19th century, a group of Swedish divers visited Great Britain. They put on diving displays that proved hugely popular and led to the formation of the first diving organisation, the Amateur Diving Association, in 1901.

          <p class="athlete-info"><h4>The exact rules of badminton have changed over time, but the aim is to land the shuttle in-bounds in the opponent's half of the court without the opponent returning it successfully. Matches are currently played to a best-of-three games, with the first to 21 points winning each game. Each player or doubles team must win each game by two clear points, except if a game reaches 29–all, a single sudden-death point is played.
                    Badminton and the Olympics
                    Badminton made its debut as a demonstration sport at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich. It was not until the 1992 Games in Barcelona that it was officially included on the Olympic programme, with men’s and women’s singles and doubles events. The mixed doubles event made its debut in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games. Since then, the number of events has remained unchanged.
                    Best badminton players to watch
                    Viktor Axelsen (Denmark) and Chen Yufei (People's Republic of China) were the singles champions at the Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020, and continue to be among the best badminton players to watch. Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Republic of Korea, India, Spain, Chinese Taipei, and Singapore have all also produced exciting badminton players to keep an eye on.
                    Badminton competition rules and event format at Paris 2024
                    Each of the five events will have a preliminary group phase, before the top 16 singles and top 8 doubles teams qualify for a direct knockout single-elimination bracket to determine the medallists.

          <p class="athlete-info"> <h4>The modern format of athletics, in which a variety of running, jumping, throwing, walking and combined events are competed at a single meeting or meet, evolved in the late 19th century, when schools and military colleges began to incorporate sports and exercise as part of education programmes. The earliest recorded meeting dates back to 1840 in Shropshire, England, but specialised championships began to thrive in the 1880s in the USA, UK, and throughout Europe, as well as in other developed nations.

          <p class="athlete-info"><h4> Diving was included in the Olympic Games for the first time at the 1904 Games in St. Louis. The springboard and platform events have been included since the 1908 Olympic Games in London. Since the Stockholm Games in 1912, women have taken part in the diving events.
          The first Olympic competitions differed from those which exist nowadays, notably with respect to the height of the platforms and springboards. The diving programme has been relatively stable since the 1928 Games in Amsterdam: men and women take part in 10-metre high-dive and 3-metre springboard events. In 2000, the Sydney Games witnessed the entrance of synchronised diving on both the springboard and the platform.
           This discipline was first dominated by the USA. This domination started to waver with the participation of China at the end of the 1980s. When the American Greg Louganis, who is considered the greatest diver ever, was still in competition, the Chinese managed to achieve some victories. Since Louganis retired, China has dominated the men’s events. Lately, China’s women divers have proved themselves unbeatable.
